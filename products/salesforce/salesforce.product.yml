  Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform. It is designed to help organizations manage their customer relationships, sales processes, marketing activities, and more.
  
  Salesforce audit logs are collected via objects, namely the SetupAuditTrail object, EventLogFile object, or Real-Time Event Monitoring objects. These objects are accessible via the Salesforce API.

  Salesforce supports a wide range of APIs, however with regards to audit logs, the primary APIs include the REST API, SOAP API, or Streaming API.
