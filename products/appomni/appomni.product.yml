  AppOmni is a cloud-based platform designed to help organizations assess, monitor, and protect their data and configurations within SaaS applications.
  
  AppOmni audit logs are collected via the *auditlogs* API, and can be streamed to a Threat Detection event sink.

  Historical audit logs are also stored for 180 days and can be accessed via the scheduled reports feature.
  There are currently minor formatting differences between API/Event Sink logs, and the logs retrieved via scheduled reports.
